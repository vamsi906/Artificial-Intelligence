% Rule to define grandparent relationship based on parent relationship
% Forward chaining: If X is the parent of Y and Y is the parent of Z, then X is the grandparent of Z.
forward_chain_grandparent :-
    parent(X, Y),             % Find parent X -> Y
    parent(Y, Z),             % Find parent Y -> Z
    \+ grandparent(X, Z),     % Check if the grandparent fact doesn't already exist
    assert(grandparent(X, Z)), % Assert new grandparent fact
    write('Inferred grandparent: '), write(X), write(' is the grandparent of '), writeln(Z),
    fail.                     % Force backtracking to find all possibilities

% The main predicate that runs forward chaining
run_forward_chaining :-
    forward_chain_grandparent;
    write('All forward chaining complete.').
